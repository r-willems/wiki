# wiki
My solution to CS50 web Wiki project. 
Please note that this is a project using the Django framework and contains a lot of boilerplate code.
Also it is a project form Harvard's CS50 courses and as such, some initial code was provided.
The main logic I wrote myself is in the encyclopedia folder in the views.py file and in the HTML files in the templates folder
